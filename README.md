# bookbot
A Bookbot built in Python from the boot.dev courses, that analyzes long-text files.

Creates a report that shows the word count of the text file, as well as a list of all alphabetical
characters from most used to least used.

BookBot is my first git project!! *Well, kinda... in this context.*
